## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
- This is part of a bigger project of creating a unified platform to interact with AWS services from a various interfaces (WEB,MOBILE,CLI,VOICE) 
- Angular 7 Web application to interact with AWS Services. Backend is served by AWS API Gateway+AWS Lambda. Authentication using Google Firebase.
- Still in the works. Should be completed by year end as I am commiting consistently but once a week.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

- Node Js & npm [Windows](https://www.guru99.com/download-install-node-js.html) [Ubuntu](https://tecadmin.net/install-latest-nodejs-npm-on-ubuntu/)
- Angular 7  ```npm install -g @angular/cli  ```
- Git ```apt install -y git```


### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

- Clone the project
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/darshan-raul/awsdashboard.git
    ```
- Change the directory to project directory
    ```
    cd awsdashboard
    ```
- Install all the dependencies
    ```
    npm install
    ```
- Run on localhost

## üéà Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>
![Architecture](/images/konsolearch2.png)

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
- Build the code for production ``` npm build --prod```
- Create a S3 static website bucket. [Steps](https://medium.com/@kyle.galbraith/how-to-host-a-website-on-s3-without-getting-lost-in-the-sea-e2b82aa6cd38)
- Copy the contents of /dist folder to the S3 bucket Either through AWS Console,SDK or CLI.
- Go to the S3 website endpoint. The app should be working seamlessly.
